# JavaScript FizzBuzz

- <b>Question 1:</b> In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain what the following lines of code do:
```
let  fizzBuzz = fs.readFileSync('./src/js/fizz-buzz.js');
eval( fizzBuzz + `\nexports.FizzBuzz = FizzBuzz;`)
```

fs.readFileSyns will return the contents of './src/js/fizz-buzz.js' <br>
The eval() function evaluates or executes an argument; *eval(string)* <br>
We have added these lines in our spec.helper for the sake of testing.
